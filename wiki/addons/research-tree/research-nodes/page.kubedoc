# Creating Research Nodes
Everything will go under the `ResearchTree.research` event

- $$exists(id: ResourceLocation)
Return `true` or `false` depending if a research node exists or not.

- $$remove(id: ResourceLocation)
Removes a research node (eg. `some_other_mod:epic_researchable`)

- $$modify(id: ResourceLocation)
Modifies a research node (eg. `another_mod:super_cool_researchable`). For methods, see below

- $$create(id: ResourceLocation)
>>> info
Internally, this constructs a `ResourceLocation` that get's set to `kubejs:[the id you chose]`
<<<

## Methods

- $$.icon(icon: Item)
The icon is just an item to point render. (eg, `minecraft:dirt` would render dirt for example)

- $$.pos(x: int, y: int)
There is also `position` that does the exact same thing

- $$.title(title: Component)
Overrides the default name (the id of the node formatted) to a custom one. Use `Text#of` for the argument

- $$.description(description: Component)
Creates a description for the research node

- $$.prerequisite(prerequisite: ResourceLocation)
This can be attached multipule times to make other research nodes required to unlock this node. 
To get the research node id, enable advanced tooltips via `F3+H`

- $$.requires(requirement: ResearchRequirement)
See (link the `helpers#Requirements` here) for possible requirements.

- $$.reward(reward: ResearchReward)
See (link the `helpers#Rewards` here) for possible rewards.

- $$.category(category: ResourceLocation)
Links the node to a category

- $$.hidden()
Hides the research from being viewed

- $$.ticksPerPercent(ticksPerPercent: int)
For every `1%` of research, the player must wait the ticks set in `ticksPerPercent` for `1%` of progression.
